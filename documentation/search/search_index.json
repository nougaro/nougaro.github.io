Comments There are two types of comments in Nougaro: single-line comments and multi-line comments. Single-line comments Single-line comments start with # and end with a new line. They can start at the beginning of a line or after some code. Example: # this is a single-line comment foo(bar) # this calls the function foo with the argument bar Multi-line comments Multi-line comments start with /* and end with */ . They can start and stop at any point in the code. Example: /* this is a multi line comment */ print(\"hello\") /* this is also a multi line comment*/ Multi-line comments can also be only on one line: print(\"hello\") /* this is a multi-line comment that is only on one line */ Multi-line comments are simply ignored, which mean you can do things such as: print( /* this is a comment */ \"hello\" /* this is another comment */) print(/* this is actually a comment*/ \"hello\") Multi-line comments can be nested: /* comment /* comment-inside comment*/ /* /* comment-ception */ */ comment */ Line joining If you don\u2019t have enough space on your line, you can join two \u201creal lines\u201d to form a Nougaro line, using a backspace. Example: var fruits = [\\ \"banana\", \\ \"apple\", \\ \"raspberry\", \\ \"pineapple\" \\ ] Blank lines Blank lines are ignored. Indentation Indentation is optional, as (mostly) every statement ends with end .
