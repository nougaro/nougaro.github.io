You're at the right place!! You have to options: either writting it in Nougaro (with limited resources), either writting it in Python (with unlimited resources). Write libs in Nougaro Requirements You need to know how to code in Nougaro. Start coding The file should be named nameofthelib.noug and be located in the lib_ folder in the Nougaro repository. Simply write all your code. If you want something to be accessible when imported, use one of those syntaxes : export identifier (as identifier) export (any expression) as identifier You can find examples of built-in modules written in Nougaro in the lib_ folder. Write libs in Python Warning Everything changed in 0.16.0-beta and in 0.19.0-beta Requirements You need to know how to code in Python. Don't worry, that's easy ;) Start coding The file should be named nameofthelib_.py (the \u201c_\u201d is VERY important!!) The file will be placed in the lib_ folder in the Nougaro repository. Paste this generic code in your file: # -*- coding:utf-8 -*- \"\"\" YourModuleName module YourModuleName is a module that do [...] and [...] and also [...]. \"\"\" # IMPORTS # nougaro modules imports from lib_.lib_to_make_libs import * # useful stuff to make libs. # built-in python imports # here put the useful python imports your module will need ;) __LIB_VERSION__ = 4 Note Lib versions depending on Nougaro versions: prior to 0.20.0: 1 0.20.0: 2 0.21.0: 3 0.22.0: 4 Lib with constants If your lib contains constants, you can add them to the code, outside any class. Use py2noug function imported from lib_to_make_libs to convert Python values to Nougaro values. Python types that can be converted into Nougaro values are: str , int , float , bool (which is converted to 0 or 1), list , tuple (converted into list), dict (converted into a list of lists, each sub-list is [key, value] ), None . Other types will return generic value Value , which you can't make anything with... Example: AMAZING_CONSTANT = py2noug(3, *default_pos()) # will be Number(3), type 'int' ANOTHER_AMAZING_CONSTANT = py2noug(\"Hello world :)\", *default_pos()) # will be String(\"Hello world :)\"), type 'str' ( py2noug and default_pos are imported from lib_to_make_libs ) Lib with functions If you want functions in your lib, paste this code in your file (replace the generic names/texts with appropriate things): class YourModuleName(ModuleFunction): \"\"\" YourModuleName Module \"\"\" functions: dict[str, builtin_function_dict] = {} def __init__(self, function_name: str): super().__init__(\"your_module_name\", function_name, \"https://link_to_report_bugs.com (not required)\", functions=self.functions) def copy(self): \"\"\"Return a copy of self\"\"\" copy = YourModuleName(self.name) return self.set_context_and_pos_to_a_copy(copy) def is_eq(self, other: Value): return isinstance(other, YourModuleName) and self.name == other.name Changed in 0.20.0-beta Prior to 0.20.0, the method is_eq was named get_comparison_eq and had this syntax: def get_comparison_eq(self, other: Value): if isinstance(other, YourModuleName): return Number(self.name == other.name, self.pos_start, other.pos_end).set_context(self.context), None return Number(False, self.pos_start, other.pos_end).set_context(self.context), None Then, to add a function, add a method in this class following this syntax: def execute_function_name(self, context: Context): \"\"\" Docstring (optional) \"\"\" assert context.symbol_table is not None ... functions[\"function_name\"] = { \"function\": execute_function_name, \"param_names\": [\"parameter_1\", \"parameter_2\"], \"optional_params\": [\"optional_parameter_1\"], \"should_respect_args_number\": True, # The two following values are used internally. # They are not documented, don\u2019t set them to True except if you know what you\u2019re doing. \"run_noug_dir\": False, \"noug_dir\": False } Changed in 0.22.0-beta Prior to 0.22.0-beta, the key \"run_noug_dir\" was called \"run_noug_dir_work_dir\" . keys param_names and optional_params should be of type list[str] . should_respect_args_number is a bool. It is True when the number of given arguments should match with the number of parameters, and False if not. You can then add code in your function. Get arguments To get the arguments given by the user in your functions, use context.symbol_table.getf(\"identifier\") Replace the identifier by the one you given to the parameter. If your parameter is optional and that the user didn\u2019t specified it, the default value is a Python None (not a Nougaro NoneValue ). Danger Please don\u2019t use .get symbol table method, it does NOT work in modules (even if it looks like) and should NOT be used. (The short explanation why is that this method looks for the name also in parent symbol table, so if an optional param is not given but the user defined a variable with that name, it will be taken as the value for that param, which is not what we want. We don\u2019t care about parent symbol table, so we just look in the current symbol table which only contains the parameters. The corresponding issue is #10 .) Values Important You often have to switch between Nougaro and Python values! To convert python to Nougaro values, use py2noug function. To convert Nougaro to python values, use noug2py . Both functions are imported from lib_to_make_libs . You reed a position with py2noug : you can simply put self.pos_start and self.pos_end or the position of any value you want. What to return? Values and errors. If you don't need to return anything, simply use return RTResult().success(NoneValue(*default_pos(), False)) . Return errors Oops! It crashed! How to say it to the user under a good shape? Simply use this syntax: return RTResult().failure(NameOfTheError( self.pos_start, self.pos_end, \"error message.\", context )) If the user gave you a value with an incorrect type, use: return RTResult().failure(RTTypeErrorF( bad_argument.pos_start, bad_argument.pos_end, \"first/second/third\u2026\", \"name of the module.name of the function\", \"type that should be found\", bad_argument, context )) Replace \"first/second/third\u2026\" by the actual index of the argument. If it is the first argument, put \"first\" , et c\u00e6tera. The error will print, for instance, second argument of builtin function 'name of the function' should be 'type that should be found', not 'type of (bad_argument)'. You can replace self by any Nougaro value, such as your arguments. For example, in the lib math : if value.value < 0: # we check if the value is greater than (or equal to) 0 return RTResult().failure(RTArithmeticError( value.pos_start, value.pos_end, \"first argument of the built-in function 'math.sqrt' must be greater than (or equal to) 0.\", exec_context, \"lib_.math_.Math.execute_math_sqrt\" )) All the errors available in a Module: RunTimeError : basic run-time error RTIndexError : IndexError RTArithmeticError : ArithmeticError RTNotDefinedError : NotDefinedError RTTypeErrorF : TypeError (you give a Number but you need a String) RTFileNotFoundError : FileNotFoundError RTAssertionError : AssertionError (not useful in libs...) RTAttributeError : AttributeError RTOverflowError : OverflowError RTRecursionError : RecursionError (new in 0.20.0) PythonError : PythonError: an error due to Python. Don\u2019t put a str error message: pass directly the Python Exception. Return values To return a Nougaro value, use return RTResult().success(value) To return a Python value, use return RTResult().success(py2noug(value, self.pos_start, self.pos_end)) WHAT_TO_IMPORT : DO NOT forget that one!! When you have finished coding your amazing lib, create the WHAT_TO_IMPORT dict. It tells to the Nougaro Interpreter what should be imported and with which name. Follow this syntax: WHAT_TO_IMPORT = { \"name_of_a_constant\": IDENTIFIER, \"name_of_a_function\": YourModuleName('function_name'), } The function name is what you specified as the key of the functions dictionary. Custom errors To use a custom error in your code, simply copy-paste this code: class YourErrorName(RunTimeError): \"\"\"YourErrorName is an error that can be triggered ONLY via functions in this module.\"\"\" def __init__(self, pos_start: Position, pos_end: Position, details: str, context: Context, origin_file: str = \"lib_.(nameofthelib)_\"): super().__init__(pos_start, pos_end, details, context, rt_error=False, error_name=\"YourErrorName\", origin_file=origin_file) Then, call it like any other errors (like this ) Note: origin_file is used for debugging. To trigger it, you can run: nougaro> import debug;debug.enable() DEBUG mode is now ENABLED. [<module debug>, None] nougaro> (anything that throws an error) Example: nougaro> import debug;debug.enable() DEBUG mode is now ENABLED. [<module debug>, None] nougaro> thisisnotdefined [identifier:\"thisisnotdefined\", end of file] list:[(var_access:[identifier:\"thisisnotdefined\"], False)] (from src.runtime.interpreter.Interpreter.visit_VarAccessNode (is NOT lib and close match in symbol table)) Traceback (most recent call last): In file <stdin>, line 1, in <program>: thisisnotdefined ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ NotDefinedError: name 'thisisnotdefined' is not defined. Did you mean 'is_none'? nougaro> this is a syntax error [identifier:\"this\", identifier:\"is\", identifier:\"a\", identifier:\"syntax\", identifier:\"error\", end of file] (from src.parser.parser.Parser.statements) In file <stdin>, line 1: this is a syntax error ^^ InvalidSyntaxError: unexpected token: identifier:\"is\". nougaro> Here, origin_file is src.runtime.interpreter.Interpreter.visit_VarAccessNode and src.parser.parser.Parser.parse . Example: RTStatisticsError in built-in lib statistics class RTStatisticsError(RunTimeError): \"\"\"StatisticsError is an error that can be triggered ONLY via functions in this module.\"\"\" def __init__(self, pos_start: Position, pos_end: Position, details: str, context: Context, origin_file: str = \"lib_.statistics_\"): super().__init__(pos_start, pos_end, details, context, rt_error=False, error_name=\"StatisticsError\", origin_file=origin_file) Examples You can read builtin files stored in lib_ folder to make you a good idea of what a nice-coded lib is ;) Here you go! If you think that your lib is absolutely awesome, you can open a PR to submit your idea. The best ideas will be implemented into vanilla Nougaro!

Changed in 0.22.0-beta Before 0.22.0-beta, a distinction was made between func (user-defined function or function in a module written in Nougaro) and built-in func (built-in function or function in a module written in Python). Numbers Numbers represents real-life numbers. The two types of numbers are int and float . To declare a number, you can use a number literal . Operations that can be used between two numbers are: addition, substraction, multiplication, power. If the second number is non-zero, division, modulo and floor division can be used. All these operations follow the mathematical logic (except for 0^0, that returns 1). Multiplication can be used between a integer (type int ) and a string or a list . For example, 3*\"str\" returns \"strstrstr\" , and 2*[1, 2] returns [1, 2, 1, 2] . In boolean context, a number is true if it is non-zero. Strings The type of a string is str . To declare a string, you can use a string literal The only operation that can be used between strings is addition, which concatenates the string with the other. For example, \"hello, \" + \"world!\" returns \"hello, world!\" . Multiplication can be used between a string and an integer (type int ). For example, \"str\"*3 returns \"strstrstr\" . In boolean context, a string is true if it contains at least one character. Lists Lists are a succession of values. To declare a list, you can use brackets ( [] ), and put every value separated by a comma ( , ) inside. They may be 0 values. To create a list with elements from another list (and other elements), you can use this syntax: [1, 2, *list_, 5] (which is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] if list_ is [3, 4] ). The only operation that can be used between two lists is multiplication, which extends the first list with the content of the second list. This can also be achieved using extend(list1, list2) Addition can be used between a list and any other value to add an element to the list. Substraction can be used between a list and an integer (type int ) to pop (i.e. delete) an element by index. This supports negative numbers. The returned value is the list after the pop. This can be achieved with pop(list, index) , although this returns the popped value. Multiplication can be used between a list and an integer (type int ). For example, [1, 2]*2 returns [1, 2, 1, 2] . Division can be used between a list and an integer (type int ) to get an element by index. This supports negative numbers. This can be achieved using list(index) or get(list, index) . In boolean context, a list is true if it is not empty None None is a value to denote the absence of other values. It is accessible trought the None built-in variable. No operation can be used on None . In boolean context, None is false. Modules A module is a value containing various useful functions and constants. A list of modules can be found here .

Types Note Python isinstance() returns True if value is an object of the given type. type Syntax: type(value: Any) Returns a str of the internal type of the value. It can be str , int , float , list , func , module , ... is_int Syntax: is_int(value: Any) Returns True if value is an integer , False if it is not. Corresponds to isinstance(value, int) . is_float Syntax: is_float(value: Any) Returns True if value is a float , False if it is not. Corresponds to isinstance(value, float) . is_num Syntax: is_num(value: Any) Returns True if value is a number , False if it is not.

Corresponds to isinstance(value, BaseFunction) where BaseFunction is function, method and builtin function. is_module Syntax: is_module(value: Any) Returns True if value is a module , False if it is not. Corresponds to isinstance(value, module) . Example: import math; is_module(math) will be True , but is_module(3.2) will be False . is_none Syntax: is_none(value: Any) Returns True if value is None , False if it is not. Corresponds to isinstance(value, NoneValue) or value is None . is_constructor Added in 0.20.0-beta Syntax: is_constructor(value: Any) Returns True if value is a constructor , False if it is not. Corresponds to isinstance(value, Constructor) . is_object Added in 0.20.0-beta Syntax: is_object(value: Any) Returns True if value is an object , False if it is not. Corresponds to isinstance(value, object) . Note: in Nougaro, everything is not an object! Type conversions str Syntax: str(value: Any) Converts value to string (may return an error). int Syntax: str(value: Any) Converts value to int (may return an error). float Syntax: str(value: Any) Converts value to float (may return an error). list Syntax: str(value: Any) Converts value to list (may return an error). String and lists operators upper Syntax: upper(value: str) Returns upper-cased string. Example: upper('nougaro') returns 'NOUGARO' . lower Syntax: lower(value: str) Returns lower-cased string. Example: lower('NOUGARO') returns 'nougaro' . split Syntax: split(value: str, <char: str = \" \">) Returns splitted string. For example, split('a b c') returns ['a', 'b', 'c'] ; split('a b c', 'b') returns ['a ', ' c'] . startswith Syntax: startswith(value: str, substring: str) Returns True if value starts with substring . Example: \"nougaro\" starts with \"noug\" , but \"canal du midi\" does not start with \"minimes\" . endswith Syntax: endswith(value: str, substring: str) Returns True if value ends with substring . Example: \"nougaro\" ends with \"garo\" , but \"canal du midi\" does not end with \"minimes\" . len Syntax: len(value: list | str) Returns the number of elements in a list (i.e. its length), or the number of chars in a str. reverse Syntax: reverse(value: list | str) Reverses list or string value by reference and returns the result. Example: reverse([1, 2, 3]) is [3, 2, 1] . append Syntax: append(list: list, value: Any) Appends value at the end of the list. Returns a list. If the list is a variable, edits the variable. pop Syntax: pop(list: list, <index: int = -1>) : Deletes value at given index. Returns the popped element. If the list is a variable, edits the variable. If index is not given, the last element of the list is popped. insert Syntax: insert(list: list, value: Any, <index: int = -1>) Inserts value at the given index in the list. replace Syntax: replace(list: list, index: int, value: Any) Replaces value at the given index in the list. extend Syntax: extend(list1: list, list2: list, <remove_duplicates: int = False>) Appends to list1 the elements of list2 . Returns list1 . If list1 is a variable, edits the variable. If remove_duplicates is True, removes the list2 elements already in list1 before extending. get Syntax: get(list: list, index: int) Returns the element of the list at the given index. max Syntax: max(list: list, <ignore_not_num: int = False>) Returns the maximum element of the list. Ignores elements that are not numbers if ignore_not_num is True , otherwise crashes if such element exists. min Syntax: min(list: list, <ignore_not_num: int = False>) Returns the minimum element of the list. Ignores elements that are not numbers if ignore_not_num is True , otherwise crashes if such element exists. sort Syntax: sort(value: list, <mode: str = \"timsort\">) Sorts list value according to mode mode . Available modes are: timsort (default), stalin , sleep , miracle and panic . timsort is Python\u2019s default algorithm stalin sends to gulag values that are not sorted (i.e. pop them from the list). Example: [1, 4, 3, 7, 6, 10, 2, 5, 23] will be sorted as [1, 4, 7, 10, 23] . sleep sort take only a list of positive integers. It starts as many threads as elements in the list, and each thread waits for as much seconds as the element. For instance, when the list [5, 2, 3, 0] is passed in sleepsort, it starts by launching 4 threads that wait for 5, 2, 3 and 0 seconds. When a thread finishes to wait, it append its element to the list. Use the mode sleep-verbose to see what\u2019s happening. miracle sort literally waits for a miracle. It checks if the list is sorted, and if it is not, it checks again. If a cosmic ray (or another miracle ) flips the right bits in your RAM so the list is sorted, miraclesort will return the sorted list. panic sort checks if the list is sorted. If so, it returns it. If the list is not sorted, this causes an illegal hardware instruction (Unix and GNU/Linux) or a segfault (Windows). Number operators round Syntax: round(number: int | float, <n_digits: int = 0>) Rounds number to the closest number with n_digits decimals. n_digits may be 0 or negative, in which case the returned type is int . Changed in 0.22.0-beta The round built-in function previously returned int only when n_digits was 0 (now it is the case when n_digits \u2a7d 0) Characters and Unicode Note There\u2019s more in the unicodedata module. ord Syntax: ord(c: str) Returns an integer representing the Unicode code point of that c . c is a string with only one character. Ex: ord('a') returns 97 and ord('\u20ac') returns 8364 . chr Syntax: chr(i: int) Returns the string representing the character whose Unicode code point is the integer i . For example, chr(97) returns the string 'a' , and chr(8364) returns the string '\u20ac' . License __gpl__ Syntax: __gpl__(<print_in_term: int = False>) If print_in_term is True , prints the General Public License 3.0 in the terminal. Otherwise, it opens the GPL in the default system program. Files __path_exists__ Syntax: path_exists(path: str) Returns True ( 1 ) if the path exists, False ( 0 ) otherwise. Technical exit Syntax: exit(<stop_code: int | str = 0>) Just quits the interpreter. clear Syntax: clear() Clears the screen. Returns None . void Syntax: void(*args) Does nothing. Returns None . run Syntax: run(file_name: str) Executes the code in the file file_name . example Syntax: example(<example_name: str | None = None>, <return_example_value: int = False>) Executes the code in the file examples/(example_name).noug . If example_name is None , executes the code in the file example.noug . If return_example_value is True , returns the list value from the example execution. system_call Warning This function may be dangerous, because any system command can be executed. Syntax: system_call(cmd: str) Calls cmd . Prints the result of the command and returnt the stop code as str . __python__ Warning This function may be dangerous, because any Python code can be executed. Syntax: __python__(source: str) Runs Python\u2019s eval(source) . __is_keyword__ Syntax: __is_keyword__(word: str) Check if word is a valid Nougaro keyword . __is_valid_token_type__ Syntax: __is_valid_token_type__(tok_type: str) Checks if tok_type is a valid Nougaro token type, such as 'EE' or 'BITWISENOT'. __test__ Syntax: __test__(<should_print_ok: int = False>, <should_i_return: int = False>) Executes the test file for the Nougaro interpreter. If should_print_ok is True , prints \u201cOK\u201d each times a test was succesful. If should_i_return is true, returns the value of the interpreted file. __py_type__ Syntax: __py_type__(value) Returns the string of Python\u2019s type(value) . For instance, __py_type__(__py_type__) is \"<class 'src.runtime.values.functions.builtin_function.BuiltInFunction'>\" __how_many_lines_of_code__ Syntax: __how_many_lines_of_code__(<print_details: Any = True>) Lets you know how many lines of code there are in Nougaro. If print_details is True, details how many lines of code they are in each file.

Example: [1, 4, 3, 7, 6, 10, 2, 5, 23] will be sorted as [1, 4, 7, 10, 23] . sleep sort take only a list of positive integers. It starts as many threads as elements in the list, and each thread waits for as much seconds as the element. For instance, when the list [5, 2, 3, 0] is passed in sleepsort, it starts by launching 4 threads that wait for 5, 2, 3 and 0 seconds. When a thread finishes to wait, it append its element to the list. Use the mode sleep-verbose to see what\u2019s happening. miracle sort literally waits for a miracle. It checks if the list is sorted, and if it is not, it checks again. If a cosmic ray (or another miracle ) flips the right bits in your RAM so the list is sorted, miraclesort will return the sorted list. panic sort checks if the list is sorted. If so, it returns it.

Disclamer from the Python source code Notes on methods for computing quantiles There is no one perfect way to compute quantiles. Here we offer two methods that serve common needs. Most other packages surveyed offered at least one or both of these two, making them \"standard\" in the sense of \"widely-adopted and reproducible\". They are also easy to explain, easy to compute manually, and have straight-forward interpretations that aren't surprising. The default method is known as \"R6\", \"PERCENTILE.EXC\", or \"expected value of rank order statistics\". The alternative method is known as \"R7\", \"PERCENTILE.INC\", or \"mode of rank order statistics\". For sample data where there is a positive probability for values beyond the range of the data, the R6 exclusive method is a reasonable choice. Consider a random sample of nine values from a population with a uniform distribution from 0.0 to 1.0. The distribution of the third ranked sample point is described by betavariate(alpha=3, beta=7) which has mode=0.250, median=0.286, and mean=0.300. Only the latter (which corresponds with R6) gives the desired cut point with 30% of the population falling below that value, making it comparable to a result from an inv_cdf() function. The R6 exclusive method is also idempotent. For describing population data where the end points are known to be included in the data, the R7 inclusive method is a reasonable choice. Instead of the mean, it uses the mode of the beta distribution for the interior points. Per Hyndman & Fan, \"One nice property is that the vertices of Q7(p) divide the range into n - 1 intervals, and exactly 100p% of the intervals lie to the left of Q7(p) and 100(1 - p)% of the intervals lie to the right of Q7(p).\" If needed, other methods could be added.

Here we offer two methods that serve common needs. Most other packages surveyed offered at least one or both of these two, making them \"standard\" in the sense of \"widely-adopted and reproducible\". They are also easy to explain, easy to compute manually, and have straight-forward interpretations that aren't surprising. The default method is known as \"R6\", \"PERCENTILE.EXC\", or \"expected value of rank order statistics\". The alternative method is known as \"R7\", \"PERCENTILE.INC\", or \"mode of rank order statistics\". For sample data where there is a positive probability for values beyond the range of the data, the R6 exclusive method is a reasonable choice. Consider a random sample of nine values from a population with a uniform distribution from 0.0 to 1.0. The distribution of the third ranked sample point is described by betavariate(alpha=3, beta=7) which has mode=0.250, median=0.286, and mean=0.300. Only the latter (which corresponds with R6) gives the desired cut point with 30% of the population falling below that value, making it comparable to a result from an inv_cdf() function. The R6 exclusive method is also idempotent. For describing population data where the end points are known to be included in the data, the R7 inclusive method is a reasonable choice. Instead of the mean, it uses the mode of the beta distribution for the interior points. Per Hyndman & Fan, \"One nice property is that the vertices of Q7(p) divide the range into n - 1 intervals, and exactly 100p% of the intervals lie to the left of Q7(p) and 100(1 - p)% of the intervals lie to the right of Q7(p).\" If needed, other methods could be added. However, for now, the position is that fewer options make for easier choices and that external packages can be used for anything more advanced.","title":"Notes on methods for computing quantiles"},{"location":"0.22/stdlib/modules/statistics/#statisticsscopelist","text":"Syntax: statistics.scope(list) Calculates the scope of a list of numbers: max(list) - min(list) .","title":"statistics.scope(list)"},{"location":"0.22/stdlib/modules/statistics/#statisticsmodelist","text":"Syntax: statistics.mode(list) Calculates the mode of a list of numbers, i.e. the most common value.","title":"statistics.mode(list)"},{"location":"0.22/stdlib/modules/statistics/#statisticsmultimodevalue","text":"Syntax: statistics.multimode(value) Calculates the modes of a list or a str, i.e. the most common values.

The Unicode standard defines various normalization forms of a Unicode string, based on the definition of canonical equivalence and compatibility equivalence. In Unicode, several characters can be expressed in various way. For example, the character U+00C7 (LATIN CAPITAL LETTER C WITH CEDILLA) can also be expressed as the sequence U+0043 (LATIN CAPITAL LETTER C) U+0327 (COMBINING CEDILLA). For each character, there are two normal forms: normal form C and normal form D. Normal form D (NFD) is also known as canonical decomposition, and translates each character into its decomposed form. Normal form C (NFC) first applies a canonical decomposition, then composes pre-combined characters again. In addition to these two forms, there are two additional normal forms based on compatibility equivalence. In Unicode, certain characters are supported which normally would be unified with other characters. For example, U+2160 (ROMAN NUMERAL ONE) is really the same thing as U+0049 (LATIN CAPITAL LETTER I). However, it is supported in Unicode for compatibility with existing character sets (e.g. gb2312). The normal form KD (NFKD) will apply the compatibility decomposition, i.e. replace all compatibility characters with their equivalents. The normal form KC (NFKC) first applies the compatibility decomposition, followed by the canonical composition.
